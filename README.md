# AI Based Document Management System

## Project Overview
The AI Based Document Management System is designed to help organizations efficiently manage, store, and retrieve documents using artificial intelligence technologies. This system leverages machine learning algorithms to automate various document management tasks, such as classification, indexing, and searching, ultimately improving productivity and accuracy in handling documents.

## Key Features
- **Automated Document Classification**: Automatically classify documents into predefined categories using machine learning models.
- **Intelligent Search**: Perform advanced search queries to find documents quickly and accurately.
- **Metadata Extraction**: Extract relevant metadata from documents to facilitate better organization and retrieval.
- **Version Control**: Keep track of document versions, ensuring that users always have access to the latest version.
- **User Access Control**: Implement robust access control mechanisms to manage user permissions and document security.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Backend development for handling document processing and storage.
- **Angular**: Frontend framework for building a user-friendly interface.
- **TypeScript**: Enhancing the development experience with type safety and modern JavaScript features.
- **Machine Learning**: Implementing AI algorithms for document classification and metadata extraction.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
